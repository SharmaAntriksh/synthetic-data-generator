"""Phase 0.2 guardrail — sales output must be independent of chunk_size.

``chunk_size`` is documented (CLAUDE.md) as a pure performance-tuning knob:
"too small = overhead, too large = memory pressure (default 1M is good)". It must
NOT change the shape of the generated data. These tests fix ``--workers 1`` (so the
only variable is ``chunk_size``, with none of the worker-scheduling nondeterminism
that Phase 0.1 covers) and compare a single-chunk run against a many-chunk run of
the same config + seed.

What they pin down (verified empirically while authoring):

* **Total row count is chunk-size invariant** — both runs emit exactly the
  requested ``total_rows``. (passes today)
* **The per-month distinct-customer curve is chunk-size invariant** (Phase 2). It
  used *not* to be: the per-month distinct target was computed against *per-chunk*
  rows and repeats were drawn only from a chunk-local pool, so splitting the same
  rows into more chunks redistributed which customers transacted in which month —
  ``base_distinct_ratio`` (a business parameter) silently depended on ``chunk_size``
  (review Finding #4/#14). Phase 2 fixes this: the coordinator computes the
  per-month rows, orders, and distinct target ONCE against the global month totals
  and each chunk slices a contiguous band of every month's order-id space
  (``chunk_builder._chunk_month_band`` + ``assign_orders_to_customers``), so the
  per-month distinct-customer set is exactly the month pool regardless of chunking.
  Now a hard regression guard (the ``xfail`` was removed when Phase 2 landed).

Because both runs are single-worker they are fully deterministic, so any regression
would be reproducible run-to-run (no scheduling flakiness): before Phase 2, at 12
chunks the per-month distinct-customer counts differed from the single-chunk run by
up to ~48 customers per month while total rows and total distinct customers were
unchanged.
