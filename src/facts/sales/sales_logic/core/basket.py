"""Order-level basket-theme correlation.

Each order is assigned a hash-seeded *theme* (a group of product subcategories);
a configurable share of its lines whose sampled product falls outside that theme
are redirected to a product inside it. This concentrates a multi-line order onto
a coherent subcategory group, so market-basket / affinity mining recovers real
association rules instead of only marginal item frequencies.

Determinism: the theme, the per-line redirect decision, and the replacement
product are all pure SplitMix64 hashes of the globally-unique
``(OrderNumber, OrderLineNumber)`` — never the chunk RNG. So the bias is
identical regardless of chunk_size or worker count, and it only changes *which*
product a line carries (never row counts or customer assignment). Distinct
salts keep it independent of the fulfillment-friction latent.
