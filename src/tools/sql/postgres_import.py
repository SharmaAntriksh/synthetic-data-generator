"""Postgres importer: apply generated CREATE TABLE + COPY scripts to a Postgres DB.

Sibling to ``sql_server_import.py``. Postgres lacks the SQL Server
lock-escalation problem that motivates the ``[admin].[ManagePrimaryKeys]``
proc (concurrent ``COPY`` sessions take compatible RowExclusiveLock), and
constraints are deferred to post-load via composer ordering — so by default
a single connection is fast enough. Pass ``load_workers > 1`` when one
table dominates the run (e.g. Sales emits 200 chunked CSVs); chunks of the
same table are then dispatched across N dedicated psycopg connections.

Beyond chunked COPY, ``load_workers > 1`` also unlocks:

  * Per-DB tuning via ``ALTER DATABASE … SET …`` at creation time
    (``wal_compression``, SSD-friendly I/O cost, work_mem) so every
    subsequent session inherits the right defaults.
  * Three-phase parallel constraint application: PK/UQ → FK NOT VALID
    + CHECK → VALIDATE CONSTRAINT. The FK ADD blocks are rewritten in
    Python from one block per FK into two — a microsecond metadata-only
    ``NOT VALID`` step and a separate ``VALIDATE CONSTRAINT`` step. The
    latter uses ``ShareUpdateExclusiveLock``, which is self-compatible,
    so multiple FKs on the same parent (e.g. Sales' six FKs) validate
    truly in parallel instead of serializing on AccessExclusiveLock.
  * Parallel index creation with ``maintenance_work_mem = 1GB`` and
    ``max_parallel_maintenance_workers = load_workers`` boosted per
    session so each CREATE INDEX uses parallel sort internally.

A post-load ``VACUUM (FREEZE, ANALYZE, PARALLEL N)`` bakes in the
visibility map + frozen xmin so the loaded rows skip the first-read
hint-bit tax and qualify for index-only scans immediately. ``COPY ...
FREEZE`` can't be used inline with parallel chunked workers (the FREEZE
precondition is that the table was created in the same transaction —
only satisfiable by one session), so we pay the freeze cost once here in
a single sequential pass.

Run-directory layout (CSV mode):
    <run>/postgres/schema/01_create_dimensions.sql
    <run>/postgres/schema/02_create_facts.sql
    <run>/postgres/load/01_copy_dims.sql
    <run>/postgres/load/02_copy_facts.sql

``import_postgres()`` connects via psycopg, optionally creates the target
database, applies the schema scripts, then the load scripts, then verifies
row counts. Connection details mirror libpq env vars
(``host``/``port``/``dbname``/``user``/``password``).
