-- VERIFY TEMPORAL COVERAGE
-- Run after loading generated data into SQL Server.
-- Checks that every month has data, no gaps, dates within configured range.
-- ============================================================================


-- ============================================================================
-- 1. Sales Coverage — Every Month Has Transactions
-- ============================================================================

-- 1a. Monthly sales count — no month should be zero
SELECT
    d.[Year],
    d.[Month],
    COUNT(f.SalesOrderNumber)                                       AS SalesLines
FROM Dates d
LEFT JOIN Sales f ON f.TimeKey = d.DateKey
WHERE d.Date BETWEEN (SELECT MIN(OrderDate) FROM Sales)
                 AND (SELECT MAX(OrderDate) FROM Sales)
GROUP BY d.[Year], d.[Month]
ORDER BY d.[Year], d.[Month];
-- EXPECTED: every month has sales > 0; no gaps

-- 1b. Identify any gap months (zero sales)
SELECT
    d.[Year],
    d.[Month]
FROM Dates d
WHERE d.Date BETWEEN (SELECT MIN(OrderDate) FROM Sales)
                 AND (SELECT MAX(OrderDate) FROM Sales)
  AND d.[Day] = 1
  AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM Sales f
      WHERE YEAR(f.OrderDate) = d.[Year]
        AND MONTH(f.OrderDate) = d.[Month]
  );
-- EXPECTED: zero rows (no month without sales)


-- ============================================================================
-- 2. Date Range Boundaries
-- ============================================================================

-- 2a. Sales dates should fall within configured range
SELECT
    MIN(OrderDate) AS EarliestSale,
    MAX(OrderDate) AS LatestSale,
    MIN(DueDate)   AS EarliestDue,
    MAX(DueDate)   AS LatestDue
FROM Sales;
-- EXPECTED: EarliestSale >= config start date, LatestSale <= config end date
--           DueDate may extend slightly past end date (fulfillment lag)

-- 2b. Customer start dates within range
SELECT
    MIN(CustomerStartDate) AS EarliestCustomer,
    MAX(CustomerStartDate) AS LatestCustomer,
    MIN(CustomerEndDate)   AS EarliestChurn,
    MAX(CustomerEndDate)   AS LatestChurn
FROM Customers;
-- EXPECTED: within configured defaults.dates range

-- 2c. Employee hire dates — should precede or fall within sales window
SELECT
    MIN(HireDate)        AS EarliestHire,
    MAX(HireDate)        AS LatestHire,
    MIN(TerminationDate) AS EarliestTermination,
    MAX(TerminationDate) AS LatestTermination
FROM Employees;
-- EXPECTED: EarliestHire may precede sales start (pre-existing staff)

-- 2d. Promotion dates within range
SELECT
    MIN(StartDate) AS EarliestPromo,
    MAX(EndDate)   AS LatestPromo
FROM Promotions
WHERE PromotionKey > 1;
-- EXPECTED: within configured date range


-- ============================================================================
-- 3. Exchange Rates Coverage
-- ============================================================================

-- 3a. FX rates should cover every day in the sales date range
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT Date) AS FXDaysCovered,
    MIN(Date)            AS FXStart,
    MAX(Date)            AS FXEnd
FROM ExchangeRates;
-- EXPECTED: FXStart <= sales start, FXEnd >= sales end

-- 3b. Any sales dates without FX rates?
SELECT DISTINCT f.OrderDate
FROM Sales f
LEFT JOIN ExchangeRates er ON er.Date = f.OrderDate
WHERE er.Date IS NULL;
-- EXPECTED: zero rows (every sales day has FX coverage)

-- 3c. All configured currencies should have rates
SELECT DISTINCT ToCurrency FROM ExchangeRates ORDER BY ToCurrency;
-- EXPECTED: CAD, GBP, EUR, INR, AUD, CNY, JPY (+ any configured extras)


-- ============================================================================
-- 4. Date Dimension Coverage
-- ============================================================================

-- 4a. Date table should cover full sales range with no gaps
SELECT
    MIN(Date) AS DateStart,
    MAX(Date) AS DateEnd,
    COUNT(*)  AS TotalDays,
    DATEDIFF(DAY, MIN(Date), MAX(Date)) + 1 AS ExpectedDays
FROM Dates;
-- EXPECTED: TotalDays = ExpectedDays (no gaps)

-- 4b. Every sales OrderDate should have a matching TimeKey
SELECT COUNT(*) AS OrphanedDates
FROM Sales f
LEFT JOIN Dates d ON d.DateKey = f.TimeKey
WHERE d.DateKey IS NULL;
-- EXPECTED: zero


-- ============================================================================
-- 5. Budget Temporal Coverage
-- ============================================================================

-- 5a. Budget years should cover the full date range
SELECT DISTINCT BudgetYear, Scenario
FROM BudgetYearly
ORDER BY BudgetYear, Scenario;
-- EXPECTED: every year in config range, each with Low/Medium/High

-- 5b. Monthly budget should cover every month in every year
SELECT
    BudgetYear,
    Scenario,
    COUNT(DISTINCT BudgetMonthStart)    AS MonthsCovered
FROM BudgetMonthly
GROUP BY BudgetYear, Scenario
ORDER BY BudgetYear, Scenario;
-- EXPECTED: 12 months per year per scenario


-- ============================================================================
-- 6. Inventory Temporal Coverage
-- ============================================================================

-- 6a. Inventory snapshots per period
SELECT
    YEAR(SnapshotDate)                                              AS SnapYear,
    MONTH(SnapshotDate)                                             AS SnapMonth,

    COUNT(DISTINCT ProductKey)                                      AS UniqueProducts,
    COUNT(DISTINCT StoreKey)                                        AS UniqueStores
FROM InventorySnapshot
GROUP BY YEAR(SnapshotDate), MONTH(SnapshotDate)
ORDER BY SnapYear, SnapMonth;
-- EXPECTED: consistent row counts per period; no missing months
--           (if grain=monthly, every month present)

-- 6b. Any months with zero inventory snapshots?
SELECT
    d.[Year],
    d.[Month]
FROM Dates d
WHERE d.[Day] = 1
  AND d.Date BETWEEN (SELECT MIN(SnapshotDate) FROM InventorySnapshot)
                 AND (SELECT MAX(SnapshotDate) FROM InventorySnapshot)
  AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM InventorySnapshot i
      WHERE YEAR(i.SnapshotDate) = d.[Year]
        AND MONTH(i.SnapshotDate) = d.[Month]
  );
-- EXPECTED: zero rows (no gaps in inventory coverage)


-- ============================================================================
-- 7. Subscription & Complaint Temporal Coverage
-- ============================================================================

-- 7a. Subscription start dates span the full range
SELECT
    MIN(SubscribedDate) AS EarliestSub,
    MAX(SubscribedDate) AS LatestSub,
    MIN(CancelledDate)  AS EarliestEnd,
    MAX(CancelledDate)  AS LatestEnd
FROM CustomerSubscriptions;
-- EXPECTED: spans configured date range

-- 7b. Complaint dates span the range
SELECT
    MIN(ComplaintDate)   AS EarliestComplaint,
    MAX(ComplaintDate)   AS LatestComplaint,
    MIN(ResolutionDate)  AS EarliestResolution,
    MAX(ResolutionDate)  AS LatestResolution
FROM Complaints;
-- EXPECTED: within configured date range
