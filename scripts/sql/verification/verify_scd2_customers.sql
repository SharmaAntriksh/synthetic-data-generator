-- CUSTOMER SCD2 — Life Event Engine
-- ############################################################################

-- ============================================================================
-- 1. Basic SCD2 Structure
-- ============================================================================

-- 1a. Version distribution — how many customers have multiple versions?

-- EXPECTED: ~85% at version 1 (unchanged), 15% with 2-4 versions
--           (governed by scd2.change_rate, default 0.15)

-- 1b. Only one IsCurrent=1 row per CustomerID

    SUM(CAST(IsCurrent AS INT)) AS CurrentCount

-- 2. Date Chain Integrity

FROM Customers
WHERE IsCurrent = 1
  AND EffectiveEndDate <> '9999-12-31';
-- EXPECTED: zero rows

-- 2c. No gaps or overlaps in date chain per CustomerID
--     (previous version EndDate + 1 day = next version StartDate)
