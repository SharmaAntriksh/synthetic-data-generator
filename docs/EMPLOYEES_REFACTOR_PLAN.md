# Store Cluster Refactor Plan (Stores + Warehouses + Employees)

Complete refactor of the coupled cluster:

- `src/dimensions/stores/` (generator, 1,365 lines)
- `src/dimensions/warehouses/` (generator, 442 lines)
- `src/dimensions/employees/` (generator, store-assignments bridge, transfer engine)

Originally scoped to employees only (2026-07 review); expanded to the full
cluster because the seams are shared: employees reads seven-plus columns off
stores.parquet (hierarchy strings, manager names, EmployeeCount, lifecycle
dates), warehouses *writes into* stores.parquet, the transfer/renovation engines
consume store lifecycle state, and the online/physical key boundary is spelled
four different ways across the three packages. Several employees-plan items that
were deferred "because the stores schema is frozen" are now properly fixable.

The plan is ordered so that **behavior-preserving refactors come first** (proven
by byte-identity), **behavior-changing fixes come after** (each with a version
bump and its own regression test). Never mix the two in one phase.

---

## Ground rules

1. **Byte-identity gate.** Phases marked *(identical)* must produce byte-identical
   `stores.parquet` (both pre- and post-warehouse-enrichment states),
   `warehouses.parquet`, `employees.parquet`, and
   `employee_store_assignments.parquet` for a fixed seed, verified by the
   Phase 0 golden-snapshot harness. Phases marked *(behavior)* bump the relevant
   `schema_version` and update the snapshots once at phase end.
2. **One concern per commit.** Bugs found mid-phase go to the Standing TODO.
3. **No phase labels in code comments or commit messages.** Phases exist only in
   this document.
4. **The output contract is frozen** except the schema additions explicitly
   gated in Phase 4 (structured manager-name columns) and the parked decisions.
   Column names, order, and dtypes of all four parquet files match
   `static_schemas.py` before and after every phase (BULK INSERT is positional).
5. **The key encoding is frozen.** Physical stores 1..N, online `10_000+i`;
   employees: CEO=1, VP=2, region `10_000+rid`, district `20_000+did`, manager
   `30M+sk`, staff `40M + sk*1000 + idx`, online rep `50M+sk`;
   `ONLINE_WAREHOUSE_KEY` for the online FC. The refactor centralizes the
   encoding; it does not change it.

### Consumers (blast radius — retest after every phase)

| Consumer | What it reads | Coupling |
|---|---|---|
| `src/facts/sales/prep/dimension_loaders.py` + `worker_cfg_builder.py` | stores arrays (keys, geography, demand weight), bridge `RoleAtStore`/`FTE`/dates | column set + role filter |
| `src/facts/sales/prep/coverage_preflight.py` | stores lifecycle + bridge coverage per store/month | coverage semantics |
| `src/facts/inventory/*` (runner, engine, worker, accumulator, micro_agg) | `stores.WarehouseKey`, warehouses.parquet | **the cross-write consumer** |
| `src/facts/budget/lookups.py` | stores.parquet | column set |
| `src/engine/runners/dimensions_runner.py` | cascade: stores → warehouses (auto-forced) → employees → ESA | regen triggers |
| `scripts/verify_employee_store_sales.py` | employee key-band arithmetic | key encoding |
| `tests/`: test_dimensions, test_transfers, test_warehouses, test_store_demand_weight, test_salesperson_performance, test_coverage_preflight | direct function calls | signatures |
| SQL DDL + Power BI TMDL (generated) | column order/dtypes, all four tables | output contract |

---

## Phase 0 — Guardrails (no production code changes)

**Goal:** make every later phase falsifiable before touching anything.

- **Golden snapshot harness** (`tests/test_store_cluster_snapshot.py`): one fixture
  (≈30 physical + 2 online stores, 3-year window, seed 42, transfers on, at least
  one closing store, one renovating store, one renovation-closed store) run
  through the full chain `stores → warehouses → employees → ESA`. SHA-256 of
  parquet-normalized frames for all four outputs, capturing stores.parquet
  **after** the warehouse enrichment (the state consumers actually see).
- **Characterization tests** for behavior to keep:
  - staffing contract: per physical store, employee roster size ==
    `EmployeeCount` (1 manager + N−1 staff); online stores exactly 1 rep;
  - every store has a `WarehouseKey` after enrichment; warehouse names unique;
    every warehouse's `GeographyKey` is FK-valid;
  - one row per employee in the initial bridge; exactly one `IsPrimary=True`
    per employee after renovation and after transfers; no assignment-date gaps
    or overlaps; `StartDate <= EndDate` everywhere;
  - coverage invariant: every constrained (open, non-renovating) store-month has
    ≥ 1 salesperson;
  - key-band integrity: every EmployeeKey decodes to its own StoreKey column;
  - store lifecycle sanity: `ClosingDate > OpeningDate`, renovation windows
    inside the dataset window, `Status` consistent with the dates as-of
    dataset end.
- **Bug-pinning tests** (`xfail(strict=True)`, fixing phase in reason):
  1. non-default `primary_sales_role` → `IsSalesperson` all-False (Phase 4);
  2. renovation temp store chosen before its `OpeningDate` / while closed
     (Phase 4);
  3. legacy stores frame without renovation columns → `KeyError` in the ESA
     renovation path (Phase 4);
  4. legacy geography frame without `Country`/`State` → `KeyError` in
     warehouses' `_enrich_with_geography` (Phase 4);
  5. a StoreKey equal to exactly `ONLINE_STORE_KEY_BASE` classifies identically
     in stores, warehouses, employees, and transfers (Phase 2 — today `>`, `>=`,
     `<`, `<=` disagree);
  6. stores.parquet's compression / date32 treatment is identical before and
     after the warehouse enrichment rewrite (Phase 6 — today the rewrite uses
     `cast_all_datetime=True` + hardcoded snappy, ignoring
     `stores.parquet_compression` and `force_date32`).

**Acceptance:** new tests pass (or strict-xfail) on `main` with zero diffs.

---

## Phase 1 — Truth restoration *(identical)*

Zero behavior change, zero logic change, all three packages.

- Employees (from the original plan): rewrite the `generate_employee_dimension`
  docstring (attrition story is gone — document the static model); delete the
  `"Voluntary"`/`"Involuntary"` comment; fix `_stores_signature`'s stale
  write-back justification; fix `run_employees(cfg: Dict)` + the
  `cfg = cfg or {}` guard; correct the "Vectorised cov build" and "single
  consolidated pass" comments; delete the duplicate cast pass and the redundant
  `~online_mask` band term; re-home `_check_coverage_invariant` (final wiring
  decided in Phase 5).
- Stores: fix `run_stores(cfg: Dict)` / `_require_cfg(cfg: Dict)` annotations
  (they take `AppConfig`); remove hardcoded date fallbacks in the runner that
  duplicate config-schema defaults (verify equality first).
- Warehouses: fix `run_warehouses(cfg, ...)` annotation; document (do not yet
  change) that the stores.parquet rewrite is the Phase 6 target.

**Acceptance:** all four snapshots unchanged; full suite green.

---

## Phase 2 — Boundary predicate & `EmployeeKeyCodec` *(identical)*

**Goal:** one named home for the online/physical boundary and the employee key
encoding. The boundary is now spelled **four ways** across the cluster:
`sk > BASE` (employees generator), `sk <= BASE` physical (transfers/renovation),
`sk < BASE` (ESA min-stores gate), `sk >= BASE` online / `< BASE` physical
(warehouses). Key 10 000 exactly classifies differently in three packages.

- `is_online_store_key(sk)` / `is_physical_store_key(sk)` live **next to the
  key allocator** — with `ONLINE_STORE_KEY_BASE` in `src/defaults.py` (a pure
  function of the constant; stores allocates keys, everyone else asks). The
  canonical rule: online ⇔ `sk > ONLINE_STORE_KEY_BASE` (matches the allocator:
  online keys start at `BASE + 1`, and the stores generator already raises if
  physical count reaches `BASE`). Route all seven call sites through it,
  including both warehouse spellings.
- `src/dimensions/employees/keys.py`: the `EmployeeKeyCodec` exactly as in the
  original plan (encode/decode/band enum, `MAX_STAFF_PER_STORE` guard), built on
  the shared boundary predicate. `_infer_home_store_key` becomes a thin wrapper;
  the bridge runner adds `StoreKey` to its `columns=` read so the authoritative
  column is primary and arithmetic is the cross-check.
- Add a guard in warehouses: raise if the running `wk` counter would reach
  `ONLINE_WAREHOUSE_KEY` (today a large-enough store estate silently collides
  with the reserved online FC key).
- Re-export old constant names unchanged (scripts and tests import them).

**Acceptance:** snapshots unchanged; Phase 0 xfail #5 flips;
`tests/test_employee_keys.py` covers every boundary value.

---

## Phase 3 — Decompose the generators *(identical)*

**Employees** — as in the original plan: `runner.py` / thin `generator.py` /
`hierarchy.py` / `staffing.py` / `lifecycle.py` / `names.py` / `hr.py` /
`assignments.py` / `transfers.py` / `keys.py`, RNG streams owned by the
orchestrator, `load_store_context()` dataclass replacing the three map-building
blocks. One addition now that stores is in scope: **delete the legacy
no-hierarchy fallback** (generator.py:390–423) instead of isolating it — stores
has emitted `StoreDistrict`/`StoreRegion` since its schema v8 and the runner
cascade guarantees fresh inputs; hard-require the columns with a clear error.

**Stores** — the 1,365-line module (≈580-line `generate_store_table`) gets the
same treatment:

```
src/dimensions/stores/
  __init__.py        # same re-exports (run_stores, generate_store_table, GeoContext)
  runner.py          # config, versioning, geography loading, parquet write
  generator.py       # thin orchestrator
  geo_sampling.py    # _sample_geography_keys + region-weight / iso-coverage modes
  hierarchy.py       # _build_hierarchy (zone → country → district/region)
  lifecycle.py       # Status assignment, opening/closing/renovation dates
  enrich.py          # names, manager names, phones, emails, descriptions
  analytical.py      # ATV / CSAT / turnover / audit / shrinkage
```

Same RNG discipline as employees: the orchestrator owns the single `Generator`
and passes it down; byte-identity proves the draw order survived. The
hash-indexed fallbacks (`sk64 * 5 + seed` brand/area/manager picks) consume no
RNG and move freely.

**Warehouses** — already reasonably sized; split only the runner from the
allocator (`runner.py` + `generator.py`), no further decomposition.

**Acceptance:** all four snapshots unchanged; no module > ~350 lines; existing
tests untouched and green.

---

## Phase 4 — Correctness fixes *(behavior — employees schema v12, bridge v20, stores v9, warehouses v4)*

Each item = one commit + one regression test flipped from Phase 0 xfail or new.

1. **`IsSalesperson`/`DepartmentName` honor the configured role** (employees
   hr.py). As in the original plan.
2. **Renovation temp-store selection checks real openness** (assignments.py).
   Replace the `Status == "Open"` filter with date-window logic
   (`_store_is_open` semantics): candidate open for the *entire* temp window.
   Root cause is now documented at the source: stores' `Status` is an
   **as-of-dataset-end snapshot** (renovations that finish reopen to "Open";
   closures flip to "Closed"), so consuming the label for point-in-time
   decisions is always wrong — the dates are the truth. Add that rule to the
   stores module docstring.
3. **Legacy-column guards**: ESA renovation warns-and-skips when renovation
   columns are absent; warehouses' `_enrich_with_geography` degrades gracefully
   (or raises a `DimensionError` naming the missing columns) instead of a raw
   `KeyError` when geography lacks `Country`/`State`.
4. **Key columns crash on corruption** (employees): replace `fillna(0)` on
   `EmployeeKey`/`StoreKey` with a raise.
5. **Assert the transfer-date invariant** (transfers.py): reject candidates
   with `transfer_date > original_end` explicitly; document the
   "Active ⇒ EndDate == global_end" assumption where the eligibility mask is
   built.
6. **Close the date-override asymmetry** (ESA runner → `allow_override=False`,
   matching employees).
7. **Structured manager-name columns** *(the schema addition — now in scope)*.
   The stores generator already holds `first, last` arrays from
   `assign_person_names` and **concatenates them, discarding the structure**
   (stores generator ~line 857–871); employees then token-splits the string back
   apart (employees generator ~line 799–819). Fix at the source: stores emits
   `StoreManagerFirstName` / `StoreManagerLastName` alongside the existing
   `StoreManager` display column (both name-pool and hash-fallback paths);
   employees consumes the structured columns and **deletes the reverse-parser**.
   Requires `static_schemas.py`, SQL DDL, and TMDL updates — this is the one
   deliberate schema addition of the plan.
8. **Inverted-date policy**: stores' opening-window swap-and-warn
   (generator ~line 910) aligns with the cluster policy — raise
   (`DimensionError`), consistent with the fix planned for dates and the
   behavior of everything else.
9. **Manager BirthDate ≥ 18-at-hire clamp** (employees hr.py). As in the
   original plan.

**Acceptance:** Phase 0 xfails #1–#4 flip; snapshots regenerated once at phase
end; full `pytest` green including sales preflight and inventory tests.

---

## Phase 5 — Unify renovation with the transfer engine *(behavior — bridge schema v21)*

Unchanged from the original plan: extract the assignment-mutation core
(`split_assignment` + `CoverageBudget` bookkeeping), renovation becomes a forced
transfer through the same machinery, fix the rollback chain bug
(`_TransferRecord` chain links; only the last un-rolled-back transfer of a chain
is eligible), wire `_check_coverage_invariant` as an unconditional runner
post-condition, kill the renovation `iterrows`. One addition: the openness
checks all route through a single store-lifecycle helper whose semantics are
owned by the stores package (dates are truth; `Status` is a display label) —
the rule Phase 4.2 establishes.

**Acceptance:** property tests (one-primary, no-gap, no-overlap, coverage)
across 20 seeds; no more cross-module private imports between assignments.py
and transfers.py; snapshots regenerated.

---

## Phase 6 — Single-writer stores.parquet *(behavior — stores schema v10)*

**Goal:** two modules currently write stores.parquet with different writer
settings. The warehouses runner rewrites it with `cast_all_datetime=True` and
hardcoded snappy, ignoring `stores.parquet_compression`,
`parquet_compression_level`, and `force_date32` — so the file's physical schema
depends on which module wrote it last. The dimensions_runner cascade
(auto-forcing warehouses whenever stores regenerates, per CLAUDE.md gotcha #7)
exists purely to compensate for the missing-column crash this split ownership
creates in inventory.

- **Recommended design: warehouse allocation moves inside the stores flow.**
  `run_stores` builds the store frame, calls the warehouse allocator on the
  in-memory frame (`generate_warehouse_table` already takes a DataFrame),
  attaches `WarehouseKey`, and writes **stores.parquet once** with its own
  configured writer settings; warehouses.parquet is written in the same stage.
  `run_warehouses` remains registered for `--regen-dimensions warehouses`
  compatibility but becomes a thin re-invoker. The gotcha-#7 cascade machinery
  in dimensions_runner is then deleted (update CLAUDE.md gotcha #7 accordingly —
  this removes one of the two cross-dimension writes it documents).
- Fallback (if the runner-registration change is judged too invasive): keep the
  two-phase flow but the warehouse runner re-writes stores.parquet **through
  the stores package's writer function with the stores config** — fixes the
  settings drift without moving ownership. Decide at phase start; recommended
  is the first option.
- Warehouses' own parquet write honors `warehouses.parquet_compression` if
  configured (today hardcoded snappy) — align with every other dimension.

**Acceptance:** Phase 0 xfail #6 flips; inventory end-to-end green; a
`--regen-dimensions stores` run no longer leaves a WarehouseKey-less window;
snapshots regenerated.

---

## Phase 7 — Realism *(behavior — employees schema v13)*

- Employees compensation by org level, terminated-employee vacation accrual,
  `EmployeeName` consistency — as in the original plan. The manager-name parse
  item is gone (solved properly in Phase 4.7).
- Stores: none required — `RevenueClass`-correlated analytics are fine. The
  roster-vs-EmployeeCount backstop mismatch (employees can force an extra
  associate for hand-built frames, making the roster exceed `EmployeeCount` and
  the `StoreDescription` headcount lie) becomes unreachable in-pipeline once
  Phase 3 hard-requires fresh stores inputs; keep the warn.

**Acceptance:** distribution tests (CEO BaseRate > every level-6 BaseRate, etc.);
quality report clean; snapshots regenerated.

---

## Phase 8 — Config & versioning hygiene *(identical except version-key churn)*

- One config-access idiom across all three packages; delete the ESA `a_cfg`
  legacy merge if unsupported.
- **Version signatures**: employees' `_stores_signature` (rows+min/max only) and
  warehouses' `_n_stores`+`_zones` are both weak content signatures whose gaps
  are currently papered over by the runner cascade. After Phase 6 the
  stores→warehouses signature disappears entirely (single flow); employees'
  signature folds in a hash of the columns it actually consumes
  (StoreKey, EmployeeCount, OpeningDate, ClosingDate, manager names, hierarchy).
  Replace the ad-hoc `_emp_key_min/max/sum` fingerprint with a content hash.
  One-time forced regen — release-note it.
- Reconcile `resolve_salesperson_roles` (coverage_preflight) with the dimension
  via a single shared helper.
- Grep-gate test: no raw `ONLINE_STORE_KEY_BASE` comparisons outside the
  boundary-predicate module.

**Acceptance:** generated data byte-identical to Phase 7 output (only version
JSON files differ).

---

## Parked decisions (not scheduled — each needs a product call)

- **Mid-window store openings do not exist.** The stores generator shifts the
  opening window entirely before `dataset_start` (generator ~lines 919–932), so
  every store opens before the data begins. Consequence: the opened-mid-window
  machinery maintained across the cluster — `store_opening_dates` hire clamps in
  employees, `_store_is_open` opened-checks, the coverage budget's `opened`
  mask — is **pipeline-dead code**, exercised only by tests. Two coherent
  options: (a) *enable openings as a feature* — stores open mid-window, managers
  and staff hired at opening (the machinery already exists and would finally
  run), which also enriches the `new-market-entry` / growth trend stories; or
  (b) *delete the dead machinery* and document the invariant "all stores open
  before dataset start". Option (a) is more valuable but is modeling work, not
  refactoring. Needs an explicit call before or after this plan.
- **Integer `DistrictId`/`RegionId` columns on stores.** Stores builds
  "District 12" strings from integers; employees regex-extracts the integers
  back (`str.extract(r"(\d+)")`) — the same destroy-then-reparse seam as manager
  names. Emitting the integer columns is the clean fix but is a second schema
  addition; the regex survives Phase 4 otherwise. Recommended: bundle with
  Phase 4.7 if approved.
- **`Status` column retirement to a derived label.** Dates are the truth
  (Phase 4.2 doctrine); `Status`/`OpenFlag` could be derived at write time only.
  Cosmetic; BI consumers expect the columns, so keep — documented here so nobody
  "fixes" the duplication ad hoc.

## Explicit non-goals

- No key-encoding changes (store, employee, and warehouse key schemes frozen).
- No revival of employee attrition; no store opening/closing *model* changes
  beyond the parked decisions.
- No changes to how sales/inventory/budget consume the outputs (beyond the
  structured manager-name columns being additive).
- No warehouse allocation redesign — the three-tier greedy grouping is sound.

## Sequencing & effort

| Phase | Type | Size | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 Guardrails | tests only | M–L | — |
| 1 Truth restoration | identical | S | 0 |
| 2 Boundary + KeyCodec | identical | S–M | 0 |
| 3 Decomposition (emp + stores) | identical | L–XL | 1, 2 |
| 4 Correctness fixes | behavior | M–L | 3 |
| 5 Transfer unification | behavior | L | 4 |
| 6 Single-writer stores | behavior | M | 4 |
| 7 Realism | behavior | M | 4 |
| 8 Config/versioning | hygiene | S–M | 5, 6, 7 |

Phases 5, 6, and 7 are mutually independent after Phase 4. Everything through
Phase 4 is the "stop the bleeding" milestone and is worth shipping even if 5–8
slip.

## Standing TODO (bugs found later go here, not into unrelated phases)

- (empty)
