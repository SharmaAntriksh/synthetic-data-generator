# Configuration Reference (`config.yaml`)

This guide documents every section and knob in `config.yaml`. Sections are listed in the same order as the config file.

## Scale

Top-level entity counts. Start here to size your dataset.

| Key | Description | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `scale.sales_rows` | Total sales transaction rows to generate. This is the primary driver of output size and run time. | `1003295` |
| `scale.products` | Number of products in the product dimension. The base Contoso catalog has 5167 products; values above that expand via stratified duplication, below that trim. | `5167` |
| `scale.customers` | Number of unique customers. Determines the customer dimension size and how many buyers are in the sales pool. | `82851` |
| `scale.stores` | Total store count (physical + online combined). | `200` |
| `scale.promotions` | Promotion counts by type. Each type creates that many promo rows per year window. Holiday promos are always auto-generated on top of these. | `{ seasonal: 11, clearance: 4, limited: 5, flash: 6, volume: 4, loyalty: 3, bundle: 3, new_customer: 3 }` |

---

## Defaults

Global settings that apply across all generators.

| Key | Description | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `defaults.seed` | Master random seed. All generators derive sub-seeds from this for reproducibility. Same seed + same config = identical output. | `42` |
| `defaults.random` | When `true`, ignores all seeds and uses OS entropy. Produces non-deterministic output every run. | `false` |
| `defaults.view_schema` | SQL schema name for generated views. `"dbo"` creates views with `vw_` prefix in dbo schema. Any other value (e.g. `"report"`, `"bi"`) creates a dedicated schema. | `"bi"` |
| `defaults.final_output` | Root folder where timestamped output packages are written. Each run creates a subfolder here. | `"./generated_datasets"` |
| `defaults.dates.start` | Global start date for all time-dependent generators (sales, exchange rates, budget, inventory). Individual sections cannot override this. | `"2021-01-01"` |
| `defaults.dates.end` | Global end date. Same coupling rules as start. | `"2025-12-31"` |

---

## Sales

Controls the sales fact table: output format, structure, and performance tuning.

### Output format

| Key | Description | Example |

| `sales.skip_order_cols` | When `true`, omits `SalesOrderNumber` and `SalesOrderLineNumber` columns. Reduces file size but disables returns generation (returns need order IDs to link back). | `false` |
| `sales.max_lines_per_order` | Maximum line items per sales order. Orders are randomly sized 1..N. Higher values create more multi-item baskets. | `8` |

### Merge & partitioning

| Key | Description | Example |

### Advanced / performance

| Key | Description | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|

| `sales.advanced.workers` | Number of worker processes for parallel sales generation. Set to `null` for auto-detect (CPU count). Don't exceed your CPU count. | `8` |
| `sales.advanced.row_group_size` | Parquet row group size. Controls memory usage during reads and predicate pushdown granularity. | `1_000_000` |
| `sales.advanced.compression` | Parquet compression codec. Options: `snappy` (fast), `zstd` (smaller), `gzip`, `lz4`, `none`. | `"snappy"` |
